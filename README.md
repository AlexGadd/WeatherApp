# WeatherApp
A webpage to display temperature data from my Pi as well as forecasting data

The plan at this point is to modify one of my existing python scripts I have running to modify a json file which the webpage will use to get info about the temperature and humidity of the house. I'd like to also have it create a graph using SQLite and Javascript, but I want to focus on getting the website to simply displaying the current temperature and getting a current weather forecast first.
